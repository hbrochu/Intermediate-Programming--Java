Procedural abstraction is the philosophy that procedure development should
separate the concern of what is to be achieved by a procedure (a Java method)
from the details of how it is to be achieved.  In other words, you can specify
what you expect a method to do, then use that method in the design of a problem
solution before you know how to implement the method.

The idea of data abstraction is to specify the data objects for a problem and the
operations to be performed on these data objects without being overly concerned
about how they (the data objects) will be represented and stored in memory.
